To play this amazing game, you will need:

- The pygame module installed on your PC

To do this there are 2 ways:
1. just install the pygame module to your python 3.? folder

2.(Easier for me!) 

- install the latest version of pycharm community edition 
- get an interpreter(this means install python 3.5 or 3.7 or 3.8 or something like that)
- then go to the pycharm settings menu
- go to Project: Souped Up Salmon Origins
- Click on Project Interpreter
- Add the interpreter (3.8 etc, etc)
- Scroll through the package options and add pycharm

Step 2 may seem to be a bit longer, but for me it was much easier (took me around 10 - 15 mins)!
